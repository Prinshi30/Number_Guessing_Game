# Number_Guessing_Game🎮

# Project Description
Number Guessing Game is a simple Java-based console game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 100 within five attempts. The program provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low, and the user wins if they guess correctly within the allowed attempts. If the user cannot guess the number within five attempts, they lose the game, and the secret number is revealed.

## How It Works 💡

1. The program generates a random secret number between 1 and 100.
2. The user has **5 attempts** to guess the number.
3. For each guess, the program provides feedback:
   - If the guess is too high, it says "Your guess is too high."
   - If the guess is too low, it says "Your guess is too low."
4. If the user guesses correctly within the given attempts, they win! 🎉
5. If the user exhausts all attempts without guessing the number, they lose. 😔
